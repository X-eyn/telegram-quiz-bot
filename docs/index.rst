Welcome to QuizBot's documentation!
===================================

QuizBot is a Telegram bot with which you can create and attempt quizzes.
A quiz is a collection of possibly random questions.

The processes and conversation of creating, attempting to, renaming, and removing existing quizzes can be shown as automata-diagrams.
Please take a look at the docs, specifically the part of the bot itself.

If you want to read more about the quiz foundation, take a look into :ref:`Quiz Foundation`.
If you want to read more about the question types, take a look into :ref:`Question Types`.
